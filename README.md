# Voice Assistant Project README

This README file provides an overview and instructions for the Voice Assistant project, which utilizes the following Python libraries: `numpy`, `transformers`, `pyttsx3`, and `speech_recognition`. This project aims to develop a voice-controlled assistant that can recognize and respond to user commands.

## Project Overview
The Voice Assistant project is designed to leverage the power of voice recognition and natural language processing to create an interactive assistant. The project relies on the following key libraries:

- **numpy**: A powerful library for numerical computations in Python, which can be used for various mathematical operations and data manipulation tasks.
- **transformers**: A library built on the popular Transformer architecture, providing pre-trained models and utilities for natural language processing tasks such as text classification, language translation, and question answering.
- **pyttsx3**: A cross-platform text-to-speech library that enables the voice assistant to convert text into audible speech.
- **speech_recognition**: A library that allows the voice assistant to recognize and transcribe spoken language into text.

By integrating these libraries, the voice assistant project can understand spoken commands, process the text, and generate appropriate responses using text-to-speech synthesis.

## Installation
To set up the voice assistant project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nikhitha284/voice-assistant.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd voice-assistant
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```
   pip install numpy transformers pyttsx3 speechrecognition wikipedia datetime webbrowser
   ```

   Ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your system.

## Usage
After completing the installation steps, you can start using the voice assistant by running the project's main script. Here's how:

1. Make sure you are in the project directory.

2. Execute the main script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. The voice assistant will start listening for your commands. You can speak naturally and provide voice instructions.

   For example:
   - "What's the weather like today?"
   - "Tell me a joke."
   - "Who is the current president of the United States?"

4. The assistant will process your command, generate a response, and speak it aloud using the text-to-speech functionality provided by `pyttsx3`.
